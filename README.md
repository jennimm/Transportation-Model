# Transportation Model
# This is a program concerning the demand and supply at multiple factories/ warehouses and the paths taken to 
# fulfil these requests.
# Currently three methods are implemented to find a path and a basic optimisation algorithm has been written,
# which checks if a solution found is optimal.
